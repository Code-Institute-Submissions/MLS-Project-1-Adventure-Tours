        <h3>Victoria Falls  <span><i>Price</i> US $670</span></h3>
           <p>Victoria Falls presents a spectacular sight of awe-inspiring beauty and grandeur on the Zambezi River, forming the border between Zambia and Zimbabwe. It was described by 
           the Kololo tribe living in the area in the 1800s as ‘Mosi-oa-Tunya’ – ‘The Smoke that Thunders’...<span id="text"></span><span id="more">n more modern terms Victoria Falls 
           is known as the greatest curtain of falling water in the world. Columns of spray can be seen from miles away as, at the height of the rainy season, more than five hundred 
           million cubic meters of water per minute plummet over the edge, over a width of nearly two kilometres, into a gorge over one hundred meters below. The wide, basalt cliff over
           which the falls thunder, transforms the Zambezi from a placid river into a ferocious torrent cutting through a series of dramatic gorges. Facing the Falls is another sheer 
           wall of basalt, rising to the same height, and capped by mist-soaked rain forest. A path along the edge of the forest provides the visitor prepared to brave the tremendous 
           spray, with an unparalleled series of views of the Falls. One special vantage point is across the Knife-edge Bridge, where visitors can have the finest view of the Eastern 
           Cataract and the Main Falls as well as the Boiling Pot, where the river turns and heads down the Batoka Gorge. Other vantage points include Livingstone Island, the Falls 
           Bridge, Devils Pool and the Lookout Tree, both of which command panoramic views across the Main Falls.</span></p><div class="btn-container"><button class="toggle">Read More</button></div>

        <p>There are two distinct geographic zones, neither are able to support viable agriculture. The flora of the well drained northern area, part of the Zambezi watershed, is 
           dominated by mopane and mixed terminalia, which is distinctly different from the rest. Elsewhere the Kalahari......<span class="text">

           vleis and fragile open grasslands on shallow soils. In the nineteen century this land was the royal hunting reserve of Mzilikazi and his successor Lobengula. But the arrival 
           of the first white hunters and settlers signalled the slaughter of its wildlife by the thousands. As their blood soaked deep into the sparse soils, it left empty, useless 
           wasteland, denuded of wildlife, unfit for farming. It was declared a game reserve in 1928 and with neighbouring Robins Game sanctuary, became a national park under he National
           Park Act of 1949. Originally, Robins Game sanctuary belonged to H G Robins, a cattle rancher.</span></p><div class="btn-container"><button class="toggle">Read More</button></div>

        <h3>Gonarezhou National Park  <span><i>Price</i> US $670</span></h3>
        <p>The 5,035 km² Gonarezhou National Park is the second largest national park in Zimbabwe, and plays host to a globally significant population of African elephant, currently 
           numbering close to 11,000 animals. The protected area was established in 1934 as a Game Reserve <span class="dots">...</span><span class="more"> and proclaimed as a national 
           park in 1975. The park is situated within the relatively remote southeast-corner of Zimbabwe on the border with Mozambique, with which it shares a 100 km boundary. The Park 
           forms an integral part of one of the largest conservation areas in the world – the Greater Limpopo Transfrontier Park (GLTP – established in 2002), which joins some of the 
           most iconic national parks of Zimbabwe, Mozambique and South Africa in a conservation area covering some 35,000 km². GNP also plays an important part of the Greater Limpopo
           Transfrontier Conservation Area (GLTFCA) which incorporates national parks, private land and concessions, and communal areas in all three countries, spanning around 100,000 km².
           <br>
           The landscape is scenic as a result of various sandstone incisions. The spectacular Chilojo Cliffs, at more than 180m high, lies at the heart of the Park  and are a result
           of the river incision of the sandstones. Perennial and temporal pans are also a common feature. Apart from the two extensive pans near the Save/Runde junction (Tembwehata 
           and Machaniwa) there are a number of larger pans which hold water well into the dry season. Steep rocky gorges with falls and rapids characterize sections of the Save, Runde
           and Mwenezi rivers. Noticeable peaks in the north are Makamandima (578m) and Mutandahwe (571m), with Nyamgtongwe (516m) in the center, and Red Hills in the south of the Park. 
           The Save Runde junction is 165m above sea level and is the lowest point in Zimbabwe.<br>
           Wildlife & Habitats
           Structurally the GNP is dominated by various types of woodland, ranging from alluvial woodlands, to mopane woodlands on heavier soils on basalts, igneous intrusive rocks and
           parts of the Malvernia Beds, plus various Guibourtia and Combretum dominated woodlands, principally on the sandier soils of the Malvernia Beds but also covering much of the 
           northern granophyre. There are additional localized occurrences of miombo (Brachystegia spiciformis, B. tamarindoides subsp. torrei and Julbernardia globiflora), Androstachys
           and Spirostachys woodlands to closed woodlands, plus dry forest patches (on alluvium), thickets (on the Malvernia sands), bushlands (principally scrub mopane on basalts and
           Malvernia Beds) and wooded grasslands (mainly on the eastern granophyre portion). Natural grasslands are virtually absent, as are Acacia woodlands, whilst aquatic systems are
           limited to the three main rivers, the two artificial dams/weirs, plus numerous small and mostly seasonal pans.</span></p><button class="read">Read more</button>

        <h3>Eastern Highlands  <span><i>Price</i> US $670</span></h3>
        <p>Running alongside the Mozambican border for some 300 kilometres, the Eastern Highlands is a mountainous area of spectacular natural beauty: rolling hills, green forests, 
           rugged peaks, misty valleys, deep gorges, cascading waterfalls, and sparkling rivers and lakes.<span class="dots">...</span><span class="more">  This is a totally different side to
           the Zimbabwe that most visitors know: the cool damp climate and lush green landscapes of the Eastern Highlands are a contrast to the dry savanna in other parts of the country.
           While there is some game in the parks of the highlands, this is not a prime safari destination. Instead, people visit the Eastern Highlands for the outdoors activities of hiking, 
           horse riding, fishing and golf, as well as the superb birdlife and the stunning scenery. The Eastern Highlands is made up of three areas – the Nyanga Highlands in the north, the 
           Bvumba Mountains in the centre and the Chimanimani Mountains in the south – each of which has its own attractions. In the rolling hills of the north, Nyanga National Park is where 
           you’ll find Zimbabwe’s highest mountain, Mount Nyangani, and its highest waterfall, Mtazari Falls as well as wildlife, lots of birds, wonderful hiking trails and excellent trout 
           fishing. The central highlands are home to the city of Mutare – the biggest settlement in the region – but the real draw is the Bvumba Mountains, where lush forests are home to rare
           bird species and the samango monkey. In the southern highlands, Chimanimani National Park is excellent for mountain hiking, while you can indulge in some forest threrapy at
           Chirinda Forest Reserve, Africa’s most southern tropical rainforest, and go horseback riding in the hills. Zimbabwe’s oldest national park, Nyanga National Park is made up of
           beautiful landscapes of rolling hills, granite outcrops, expansive valleys and deep gorges. It’s home to the highest mountain in the country – Mount Nyangani – and the 762-metre 
           Mtazari Falls, Zimbabwe’s highest waterfall, as well as kudu, klipspringer, reedbuck, blue duiker and samango monkeys, rich archaeological sites and an incredible wealth of birds – 
           more than 300 species – making it a birding hotspot. Fishing for trout is a popular activity here, as is hiking. The standout hike is the five-night Turaco Trail, one of the 
           country’s most scenic hikes, which traverses magnificent mountain and forest landscapes through Mutarazi Falls and Nyanga National Parks to the summit of Chikorokoto, passing 
           waterfalls, rivers, valleys and grasslands on the way. In the central highlands, the lush forested Vumba Mountains – “Mountains of the Mist” – is a top birding destination, with 
           a number of special species that can be spotted (it’s a good idea to hire a birding guide to help you). One of the world’s best championship golf courses is here at the Leopard 
           Rock Hotel, while the beautiful Vumba Botanical Gardens are worth exploring for wonderful exotic and indigenous plant life. In the south of the highlands, the dramatic mountain 
           scape of Chimanimani National Park is renowned as a serious hiking destination although horse riding is also popular. Multi-day hikes are the best way to explore the rugged park. 
           You can camp anywhere in the reserve or, for something thrillingly different, sleep in one of the caves scattered throughout the park.</span></p>

           The sanctuary, one of the only two pockets of nyala in the country, is also home to 16 000 buffalo and more than 12 000 elephant - Zimbabwe's largest concentration after Hwange. 
           Many female elephants in the region do not have tusks and are much more aggressive than those with tusks. Along the river bank where one of the greatest varieties of bird life in 
           the world flourishes, hippos warm themselves in the morning sun. Later in the day, they keep cool by remaining all but submerged in the river, sharing their hidden sandbanks with 
           silent and almost unseen crocodiles. More than 380 bird species  are enough to draw the breath of any ornithologist. Its banks flutter with Goliath herons, Egyptian and Spurwing 
           geese, cormorants, storks, brilliantly coloured bee-eaters, and kingfishers.</span></p> <button class="read">Read more</button>

           distinctive rock landforms rising above the granite shield that covers much of Zimbabwe. The large boulders provide abundant natural shelters and have been associated with 
           human occupation from the early Stone Age right through to early historical times, and intermittently since. They also feature an outstanding collection of rock paintings. 
           The Matobo Hills continue to provide a strong focus for the local community, which still uses shrines and sacred places closely linked to traditional, social and economic

        <p>The word Zimbabwe consists of two key root words, -mba- which means house; and -bwe, which means stone. The word therefore means "House of Stone". In conventional usage
